[first lines; Ana is getting ready in her apartment that she shares with Kate who’s lying sick on the couch]
Kate: Ana, take my car. I gave you the recorder right?
Anastasia Steele: Uh…yes.
Kate: And you have all the questions?
Anastasia Steele: Yes.
Kate: And you know where you’re going?
Anastasia Steele: Yes, I do have a GPS, and a four point O GPA. I can figure it out.
Kate: You’re wearing that?
Anastasia Steele: Okay, maybe a little less talking, more eating. Bye.
[she kisses Kate’s forehead before leaving]
[Ana pulls up outside Grey Enterprises building, gets out of her car and looks up at the building before entering]
Receptionist #1: Miss Kavanagh? May I take your coat?
Anastasia Steele: Oh, yeah
[Ana takes off her coat to give to the receptionist]
Anastasia Steele: Um, Uh… Okay.
Receptionist #2: Mr. Grey will see you now.
Anastasia Steele: Okay.
[Christian’s secretary, Andrea approaches Ana]
Andrea: This way please.
Anastasia Steele: Okay.
[Ana follows Andrea]
[Andrea takes Ana to Christian’s office]
Andrea: Right this way.
[as Andrea opens the door, Ana stumbles and falls forward on her hands, Christian walks over to her]
Christian Grey: Miss Kavanagh. Are you alright?
[he helps Ana stand]
Christian Grey: Christian Grey.
Anastasia Steele: I’m Anastasia Steele. Um, Miss Kavanagh has the flu, so she asked me to fill in.
Christian Grey: I see. So you’re studying journalism as well.
Anastasia Steele: No, English Lit. Um, Kate’s my roommate.
Christian Grey: As I said, I only have ten minutes. Please, have a seat, Miss Steele.
[Christian takes sits behind his desk as Ana takes the seat opposite]
[as Ana has forgot her pen, she notices pencils on Christian’s desk, Christian gets up, picks up a pencil and gives it to Ana]
Anastasia Steele: Thank you. Ready?
Christian Grey: Whenever you are.
Anastasia Steele: Uh, okay.
[Ana looks down at the paper with her questions on them]
Anastasia Steele: Um, so this is for the special graduation issue of the student newspaper.
Christian Grey: Yes, I’m giving the commencement address at this year’s ceremony.
Anastasia Steele: You are? I mean, um…I know.
[Ana looks down at her questions]
Anastasia Steele: Uh, you are very young to have amassed such an empire. To what do you owe your…
Christian Grey: To what do I owe my success?
Anastasia Steele: Yep.
Christian Grey: Seriously?
Anastasia Steele: Yes.
Christian Grey: Business is about people, and I’ve always been good at people. What motivates them, what incentivizes them, what inspires them.
Anastasia Steele: Maybe you’re just lucky.
Christian Grey: I’ve always found that the harder I work the more luck I seem to have. The key to my success has been in identifying talented individuals and harnessing their efforts.
Anastasia Steele: So you’re a control freak?
Christian Grey: Oh, I exercise control in all things, Miss Steele.
[Ana looks at her questions again]
Anastasia Steele: Okay. Um, uh, your company is involved primarily in the telecommunications sector. Yet you also invest in numerous agricultural projects, including several in Africa. Is that something that you feel passionate about? Feeding the world’s poor?
Christian Grey: It’s smart business.
[Ana looks at him disapprovingly]
Christian Grey: You don’t agree?
Anastasia Steele: I don’t know enough about it. I just wonder if perhaps your heart might be a bit bigger than you want to let on.
Christian Grey: There’s some people that say I don’t have a heart, at all.
Anastasia Steele: Why would they say that?
Christian Grey: Because they know me well. Go on.
[Ana looks at her questions]
Anastasia Steele: Um, do you have any interests outside of work?
Christian Grey: I enjoy various physical pursuits.
[looking at her notes]
Anastasia Steele: You’re unmarried…oh, you were adopted at age four.
Christian Grey: That’s a matter of public record.
Anastasia Steele: I’m sorry I didn’t…
Christian Grey: Do you have an actual question, Miss Steele?
Anastasia Steele: Yeah, sorry.
[looking down at the questions]
Anastasia Steele: Are you gay?
[realizing what she’s just read Ana chuckles nervously]
Anastasia Steele: It’s written here, I’m just…
Christian Grey: No, Anastasia. I’m not gay.
Anastasia Steele: I apologize, Mr. Grey, Kate can be a little…
Christian Grey: Intrusive?
Anastasia Steele: Curious.
Christian Grey: What about you?
[he takes the seat next to Ana]
Christian Grey: Why don’t you ask me something that you want to know?
Anastasia Steele: Earlier you said that there are some people who know you well. Why do I have the feeling that that is not true?
[just then Andrea opens the office door]
Andrea: Mr. Grey, your next meeting is in the conference room.
Christian Grey: Cancel it, please. We’re not finished here.
Andrea: Yes, sir.
[Andrea closes the door]
Anastasia Steele: No, I, um…I can go. It’s fine.
Christian Grey: I would like to know more about you.
Anastasia Steele: There’s really not much to know about me.
Christian Grey: You said you’re in English major? Tell me was it Charlotte Brontë, Jane Austen or Thomas Hardy, who first made you fall in love with literature?
Anastasia Steele: Hardy.
Christian Grey: I would’ve guessed Jane Austen.
[Ana smiles at him]
Christian Grey: What are your plans for after you graduate?
Anastasia Steele: I’m just trying to get through finals right now.
Christian Grey: And then?
Anastasia Steele: And then I was planning on moving here to Seattle with Kate.
Christian Grey: We offer an excellent internship program.
Anastasia Steele: I don’t think I’d fit in here.
[Ana laughs]
Anastasia Steele: Look at me.
Christian Grey: I am.
[Christian escorts Ana to the elevator]
Christian Grey: I hope you got everything you needed.
Anastasia Steele: I…I think you only answered four questions.
[as the elevator arrives, Ana turns to step into it, Christian notices the piece of paper containing her questions sticking out of her notebook and quickly grabs it]
Christian Grey: Anastasia.
Anastasia Steele: Christian.
[as Ana steps out of the building and into the rain, she takes deep breaths]
Anastasia Steele: Holy cow.
[Ana enters the apartment to find Kate sitting at the table looking at her laptop]
Anastasia Steele: Um, before you say anything…
Kate: You’re a goddess, this is perfect.
Anastasia Steele: What?
Kate: I just got his email, he answered every question. So? What was he like?
Anastasia Steele: Uh…he was fine.
Kate: Fine? Just fine?
Anastasia Steele: Um, he was really polite, and he was courteous, and very formal and…and
clean.

Kate: Clean?
Anastasia Steele: I mean, he was very, you know, smart and intense. It was kind of intimidating. I can understand the fascination.
Kate: Uh-huh!
Anastasia Steele: Why are you looking at me like that?
Kate: Like what?
Anastasia Steele: Okay. I’m gonna make a sandwich, do you want one?
Kate: No, thanks.
[looking at Christian’s photos on her laptop]
Kate: You have to admit, he’s ridiculously hot.
Anastasia Steele: I’m sure if you are attracted to that sort of human, then…
Kate: The hot type of human?
Anastasia Steele: I asked him if he was gay, that was in your questions. Why would you do that to me?
Kate: Because whenever he’s in the society pages, he’s never been photographed with a woman. So naturally…
Anastasia Steele: Well maybe he just wants to keep his private life private, Kate.
Kate: And now you’re defending him.
Anastasia Steele: I’m terminating this conversation.
Kate: Too bad we don’t have some original stills of your hot, clean, twenty-seven year old billionaire. The camera loves him almost as much as you do.
[Ana gives her a disapproving look]
Kate: Okay, I wasn’t hungry, but now I am.
[Kate takes the sandwich that Ana had just made]
Kate: Thank you.
[she bites into the sandwich]
Kate: I love you.
[as Kate walks away, Ana sits by the laptop and look at Christian’s photos]
[after her class Ana walks over to her car in the parking lot when her friend, Jose, comes over to her]
Jose: Ana, I’ve been looking for you.
Anastasia Steele: What’s up?
Jose: Guess what?
Anastasia Steele: What?
Jose: Portland’s Place is going to exhibit my photographs next month.
Anastasia Steele: Oh, my God!
[Ana hugs Jose]
Anastasia Steele: Congratulations, that’s so good! Can we celebrate later? Cause I’m really late for work.
Jose: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You got it, you got it.
[as Ana goes to open her car door]
Jose: Hold on. Hold on, hold on.
[Jose opens the car door for Ana]
Anastasia Steele: Thank you, you’re my hero.
[Ana gets into her car]
Jose: See you later.
Anastasia Steele: Okay.
[Jose waves goodbye to Ana as she drives off]
[Ana is at work at a hardware store when she gets a call from her mother, Carla]
Anastasia Steele: Mom, I’m at work can I call you back?
Carla: Oh, no, wait. Wait, wait. I called for a reason. Bob broke his foot playing golf of all things.
Anastasia Steele: God, is he okay? Is he in a lot of pain?
Carla: Who can tell? The man calls the paramedics for a blister. It means though, we won’t be able to fly in for graduation.
Anastasia Steele: Really? I mean, you don’t want to just come alone? You don’t have to bring Bob.
Carla: And leave Tiger Woods to fend for himself? You understand, don’t you, darling?
[Ana looks visibly upset]
Anastasia Steele: Yeah. Yeah, it’s fine. I really have to go, okay?
Carla: I love you, Ana.
Anastasia Steele: I know. I love you too.
[Ana ends the call]
Anastasia Steele: God.
[Ana’s manager, Paul, comes over to her]
Paul Clayton: Ana, could you give me a hand out back?
Anastasia Steele: Uh, yeah, yeah. I’ll be right there.
[as Ana walks by an aisle she’s suddenly startled to find Christian standing there]
Christian Grey: I thought it was you.
Anastasia Steele: What the…?
Christian Grey: What a pleasant surprise, Miss Steele.
Anastasia Steele: Just Ana. Just Ana. You’re in here.
Christian Grey: I was in the area on business, needed to pick up a few things. Are you free?
Anastasia Steele: Yeah. What can I help you with?
Christian Grey: Do you stock cable ties?
Anastasia Steele: Cable ties, yes, we do. I can show you, if you want.
Christian Grey: Please, lead the way, Miss Steele.
Anastasia Steele: Just Ana.
[Ana takes Christian to the cable ties]
Anastasia Steele: Is that it?
Christian Grey: Masking tape.
Anastasia Steele: Are you redecorating?
[Ana takes Christian to the masking tapes]
Christian Grey: No.
Anastasia Steele: Um, we have two inch and one inch. But the truly self-respecting handyman will have both in his tool box.
Christian Grey: Of course he will.
Anastasia Steele: It’s rare to find a connoisseur these days. Do you want anything else?
Christian Grey: Yes, rope.
[as Ana is getting Christian some rope]
Christian Grey: That’s impressive. Are you a girl scout?
Anastasia Steele: Um, no. Organized group activities aren’t really my thing.
Christian Grey: So what is your thing?
Anastasia Steele: Um, I don’t know. Books?
[Ana chuckles]
Anastasia Steele: Okay. Rope, tape, cable ties. You’re the complete serial killer.
Christian Grey: Not today.
Anastasia Steele: Anything else?
Christian Grey: What would you recommend?
Anastasia Steele: For a do-it-yourselfer? Um, maybe coveralls so you protect your clothes?
Christian Grey: I could just take all my clothes off.
Anastasia Steele: Okay, no clothes. I mean, no coveralls. You…I can’t really think of anything else.
Christian Grey: Well, I guess that’s it then.
Anastasia Steele: Cool.
[at the cash register Ana bags up Christian’s things]
Anastasia Steele: Thank you for answering Kate’s questions by the way, she was thrilled.
Christian Grey: Well I hope she’s feeling better.
Anastasia Steele: She is, yeah, much. She’s just having a hard time clearing a photo of you.
Christian Grey: If she’d like an original, I’m around tomorrow.
Anastasia Steele: You’d be willing to do that?
Christian Grey: Yeah.
[just then Paul comes up behind Ana and puts his hands on her shoulders]
Paul Clayton: Want me to bag for you, Ana?
Anastasia Steele: Oh. Uh, no, no, no. I’m good. Thanks though, Paul.
[Christian gives Paul a cold look and Paul walks away]
Anastasia Steele: Okay.
[Christian places his business card on the counter]
Christian Grey: I’m staying locally at the Heathman. Call me before ten.
[Ana looks at him confused]
Christian Grey: About the photos.
Anastasia Steele: Oh. Yeah, I will.
[Ana takes the business card]
Anastasia Steele: Enjoy your…
[Christian turns and leave the shop, Ana watches him through the window as he gives his bag to his driver, Taylor, and get into his car]
[Jose is taking pictures of Christian as Kate and Ana watch from the side]
Kate: Thanks again for doing this, Mr. Grey.
Christian Grey: I’m happy to help.
[to Christian]
Jose: Uh…how about if we try a few with a smile?
[Jose takes more photos but Christian still doesn’t smile]
Jose: Or not.
[as they watch Christian being photographed]
Kate: You do realize that he hasn’t stopped looking at you?
Anastasia Steele: He asked me to go for coffee afterwards.
Kate: What?
[Kate starts to laugh]
Anastasia Steele: Kate, shh.
[after the photo shoot, as they walk down the hotel corridor]
Christian Grey: So is he your boyfriend?
Anastasia Steele: Who?
Christian Grey: The photographer.
[Ana laughs]
Anastasia Steele: Jose? No.
Christian Grey: I saw the way he was smiling at you.
Anastasia Steele: No, Jose is more like family. He’s not my boyfriend.
Christian Grey: And the guy at the store?
[looking at Christian with shock]
Anastasia Steele: Paul? No.
[Ana and Christian are sat at the coffee shop, Christian pours Ana some tea]
Anastasia Steele: Thank you.
Christian Grey: You seem nervous.
Anastasia Steele: I find you intimidating.
Christian Grey: You should.
[he places a muffin in front of Ana]
Christian Grey: Eat.
Anastasia Steele: Not to mention high-handed.
Christian Grey: I’m used to getting my own way.
Anastasia Steele: Well it must get very boring.
Christian Grey: Tell me about your family.
Anastasia Steele: My family? Um, okay. My dad died when I was a baby, so I was raised by my step-father Ray. He’s amazing.
Christian Grey: And your mother?
Anastasia Steele: Um, my mother is on husband number four. She’s an incurable romantic.
Christian Grey: And you?
Anastasia Steele: Am I a romantic?
[Christian nods his head]
Anastasia Steele: Well I study English Lit, so I kind of have to be. Thought the photo shoot went well. Right? Kate seems to be really happy…
Christian Grey: I’m sorry, I can’t.
Anastasia Steele: What?
Christian Grey: I’ll walk you out.
[Christian gets up; outside Christians walks beside Ana]
Anastasia Steele: Do you have a girlfriend, is that it?
Christian Grey: I don’t do the girlfriend thing.
Anastasia Steele: What does that even mean?
[as they go to cross the street Ana is almost hit by a biker when suddenly Christian pulls her out of the way]
Christian Grey: Watch it!
[he holds onto Ana and touches her face tenderly]
Christian Grey: I’m not the man for you. You should steer clear of me. I have to let you go.
[Ana clearly looks hurt]
Anastasia Steele: Goodbye, Mr. Grey.
[Ana walks away]
[after finishing their final exam Kate goes over to Ana]
Kate: Hey, you all good?
Anastasia Steele: Yeah, why wouldn’t I be?
Kate: We are so partying tonight.
[Ana chuckles]
Anastasia Steele: Oh, my God.
[later Kate helps Ana put makeup on her face]
Anastasia Steele: This is way too much. You’re getting it…
Kate: No, this is exactly the right amount.
Anastasia Steele: All over my face?
Kate: That’s the idea.
[Ana looks in the mirror]
Anastasia Steele: Wow. No, Kate.
[just then their doorbell rings]
Kate: Cab’s early. Let’s go. Ana, there’s a package for you.
[Kate reads the note on the package]
Kate: “Why didn’t you tell me there was danger? Why didn’t you warn me? Ladies know what to guard against because…
Kate, Ana: …they read novels that tells them of these tricks.”
Anastasia Steele: That’s a quote from Tess of the d’Urbervilles.
[Ana opens the package to find three books]
Anastasia Steele: Oh, my God. These must be from Christian.
[Ana opens one book]
Anastasia Steele: Do you…? I mean…these are incredible.
Kate: Wow, great.
Anastasia Steele: Kate, these are first editions. I can’t, this is too much. I can’t accept these, I have to send them back.
[they hear a car honking its horn]
Kate: That’s the cab. Okay, are you ready?
Anastasia Steele: Yes.
Kate: Are you really though?
Anastasia Steele: Yes, very.
Kate: Let’s get out of here.
[later at the club after drinking a shot; to Ana]
Kate: Did you do it all?
[Ana shakes her head]
Jose: Alright! With my right eye closed and left handed, I can get this in. Ready? One, two…
[Ana turns to go]
Kate: What?
Anastasia Steele: I gotta pee.
Kate: Okay.
Jose: Where you going?
Anastasia Steele: I gotta go. I gotta pee.
[Ana gets up and leaves]
[standing in line for the ladies a drunk Ana decides to call Christian]
Christian Grey: Anastasia?
Anastasia Steele: Yeah, this is me. I’m sending back your expensive books, cause I already have copies of those. Thanks though for the kind gesture.
Christian Grey: You’re welcome. Where are you?
Anastasia Steele: Oh…I’m in line, cause I have to pee really bad.
Christian Grey: Anastasia, have you been drinking?
[Ana chuckles]
Anastasia Steele: Yeah, I have, Mr. Fancy Pants. You hit the hail…hail on the nead. I mean the head on the nail.
Christian Grey: Listen to me, I want you to go home right now.
Anastasia Steele: You’re so bossy!
[doing a mocking impression of Christian’s voice]
Anastasia Steele: Ana, let’s go for coffee. Ana, let’s go for coffee. No, stay away from me, Ana. I don’t want you. Get away. Come here, come here. Go away.
Christian Grey: That’s it. Tell me where you are.
Anastasia Steele: A long way from Seattle. Long way from you.
Christian Grey: Which bar, what’s it called?
Anastasia Steele: I don’t know, I gotta go though.
Christian Grey: Which bar, Ana?
[Ana ends the call; to the girl next to her in line]
Anastasia Steele: I told him, right?
[Christian calls Ana back]
Anastasia Steele: I’m sorry I didn’t mean…
Christian Grey: Stay where you are, I’m coming to get you.
Anastasia Steele: What?
[Christian ends the call]
Anastasia Steele: Hello?
[Ana goes outside the club and Jose finds her]
Jose: Hey.
[he puts her jacket on her]
Anastasia Steele: Oh, thanks.
Jose: You okay?
Anastasia Steele: Yeah, I’m just feeling a little more drunk than…
[Jose chuckles when she can’t finish her sentence]
Jose: Come here stay warm.
[Jose pulls Ana close into his arms]
Anastasia Steele: Oh, that’s cool. I’m good, Jose. I got it.
[Ana tries to pull away]
Jose: I don’t know when I’ll have the courage to do this.
Anastasia Steele: Do what?
Jose: Ana…
Anastasia Steele: No.
Jose: I like you.
Anastasia Steele: You do?
Jose: Very much.
Anastasia Steele: Oh, my God.
Jose: Look, please, one kiss.
Anastasia Steele: No. No, no, no. Jose, I don’t…I’m sorry, no.
[as Jose leans in to kiss her suddenly Christian appears and pushes Jose away from Ana]
Christian Grey: Dude, she said no.
Anastasia Steele: Christian?
[Ana pukes and Christian holds her hair back]
Anastasia Steele: Don’t look at me.
[he gives Ana his handkerchief]
Christian Grey: Here.
[after wiping her mouth Ana looks at the handkerchief]
Anastasia Steele: Nice touch. I will launder this item.
Christian Grey: Let’s get you home.
Anastasia Steele: I’m with Kate.
Christian Grey: I’ll have Elliot tell her.
Anastasia Steele: Who’s Elliot?
Christian Grey: He’s my brother. He’s inside talking to her right now.
Anastasia Steele: How…I don’t…?
Christian Grey: He’s at my hotel with me.
Anastasia Steele: You’re still at the Heathman?
Christian Grey: Yeah. Come.
[back inside the club, Kate is dancing with Elliot, Ana watches as Christian goes over to Elliot to speak with him for a moment before heading back to her]
Anastasia Steele: That’s your brother?
Christian Grey: Not by choice. Let’s go.
Anastasia Steele: Wait what did Kate say?
Christian Grey: She warned me to be on my best behavior. More like threatened me.
[Ana laughs]
Anastasia Steele: She threatened you?
[Ana looks at Christian]
Anastasia Steele: You’re spinning. I think I’m gonna faint.
Christian Grey: What, now?
[just then Ana passes out, Christian holds onto her to stop her from falling]
[Ana wakes up in Christian’s hotel room, she sees some pills and glass of orange juice on the bedside table with the notes “Eat me”, “Drink me” next to each, as she takes the pills Christian enters the room after his morning run]
Christian Grey: Good morning, Anastasia. How are you feeling?
Anastasia Steele: Better than I deserve. Did you put me to bed?
Christian Grey: Mm-hmm.
Anastasia Steele: You undressed me?
Christian Grey: I didn’t have much choice.
Anastasia Steele: Where did you sleep?
[he points to the space next to her in bed]
Anastasia Steele: Oh, my God. Did we…? We didn’t…?
Christian Grey: Necrophilia is not my thing.
Anastasia Steele: So we just slept then?
Christian Grey: It was a novelty for me too.
[Christian goes over to her and gives her some toast]
Christian Grey: You…need to eat. I had Taylor pick you up some clothes.
Anastasia Steele: Who’s Taylor?
Christian Grey: My driver.
Anastasia Steele: Thank you, but you didn’t have to do that.
Christian Grey: Yes, I did. Yours were covered in vomit. You shouldn’t get drunk like that. I’m all for testing the limits, but you put yourself at risk last night.
Anastasia Steele: I know.
[Christian takes off his t-shirt]
Christian Grey: If you were mine you wouldn’t be able to sit down for a week.
[Christian goes over to her and sits opposite it her on the bed]
Anastasia Steele: What?
[Christian takes a bite out of her toast]
Christian Grey: I gotta go take a shower.
[Christian walks to the bathroom]
Anastasia Steele: Why am I here, Christian?
[Christian stands by the bathroom doorway]
Christian Grey: You’re here because I’m incapable of leaving you alone.
Anastasia Steele: Then don’t. Why did you send me those books?
Christian Grey: I thought I owed you an apology.
Anastasia Steele: For what? For letting you believe that I… Listen to me.
[he sits next to her on the bed]
Christian Grey: I don’t do romance. My tastes are very…singular. You wouldn’t understand.
Anastasia Steele: Enlighten me then.
[he touches her face tenderly, he leans in to kiss her but stops himself and instead walks into the bathroom]
[Ana walks out of the bathroom wearing the clothes Taylor had bought her]
Christian Grey: You look beautiful.
Anastasia Steele: Taylor has good taste.
Christian Grey: What are you doing later?
Anastasia Steele: I’m working at the hardware store till seven.
Christian Grey: I’ll have Taylor pick you up then.
[Ana bites her lip and looks down]
Christian Grey: I’d like to bite that lip.
Anastasia Steele: I think I’d like that too.
Christian Grey: I’m not gonna touch you, not until I have your written consent.
Anastasia Steele: What?
Christian Grey: I’ll explain later. Come, I’ll take you home.
[Christian and Ana enter the elevator, he sees Ana bite her lip again]
Christian Grey: Fuck the paperwork.
[he suddenly takes a hold of Ana and kisses her passionately, just as they are getting into it the elevator doors open and a group of business men enter, Christian looks at Ana]
Christian Grey: What is it about elevators?
[Ana smiles]
[Ana and Christian enter her apartment to find Elliot and Kate naked on the couch, Elliot gets up to get dressed]
Elliot Grey: Hey.
Anastasia Steele: Hey.
Elliot Grey: Hi, you must be Ana.
[they shake hands]
Anastasia Steele: You must be Elliot.
Elliot Grey: And we must be going, Elliot.
[to Ana]
Elliot Grey: So awesome to meet you. Kate’s told me a lot about you.
Christian Grey: Elliot, find your shoes. Some of us have work to attend to.
Elliot Grey: What are you doing with Mr. Warmth here, I have no idea.
[Ana smiles]
[Ana and Christian watch uncomfortably as Elliot kisses Kate goodbye]
Elliot Grey: Laters, baby.
[Elliot walks out of the apartment; to Ana]
Christian Grey: I’ll see you tonight. Email me if something changes.
Anastasia Steele: My computer’s broken.
Christian Grey: Well call then, you know you have my number.
[he touches her face]
Christian Grey: Laters, baby.
[Christian leaves]
Anastasia Steele: Elliot seems really nice.
[Ana laughs]
Kate: No, no. We’re starting with you. If you’re seeing him again tonight, that means that something happened. Ana?
[Ana avoids answering and starts to walk away]
Anastasia Steele: I have to get ready for work.
[they both laugh]
Anastasia Steele: We just kissed. Once.
Kate: Only once? That’s odd.
Anastasia Steele: Mm. Odd doesn’t even cover it.
Kate: Uh-huh.
[Ana turns and starts walking to her room]
Kate: And a new jacket. Hm.
[after finishing work, Ana walks out of the store to see Taylor waiting for her]
Anastasia Steele: Hi. It’s Taylor, right?
Taylor: Good evening, Miss Steele. Mr. Grey will be joining us there.
[he takes Ana to meet Christian on the roof of a building standing next to his helicopter]
Christian Grey: Good evening, Anastasia.
[he opens the helicopter door for Ana and she gets in, Christian takes the pilot’s seat]
Anastasia Steele: Are you flying this?
[Christian straps the seat belts around her]
Christian Grey: No escaping now.
[into the radio as he gets ready to take off]
Christian Grey: November 1-2-2-4. Charlie Tango. Ready to depart.
Control Center: Roger that, Charlie Tango. Your flight plan from Portland to Seattle is cleared.
Christian Grey: Seattle? That’s where we’re going?
[Ana smiles as they take off and Christian flies them to Seattle]
[Christian takes Ana his apartment in Seattle]
Christian Grey: Would you like a drink?
Anastasia Steele: Yes, please.
[Christian goes to get her a drink, Ana is shocked at the expensive looking apartment]
Anastasia Steele: Wow.
[she walks over to the piano]
Anastasia Steele: Do you play?
Christian Grey: Yes.
[Ana chuckles to herself]
Anastasia Steele: Of course you do.
[referring to the piece of paper on the table]
Anastasia Steele: What’s this?
Christian Grey: It’s a non-disclosure agreement. It means that you cannot discuss anything about us with anyone. I’m afraid my lawyer insists on it.
Anastasia Steele: I’d never talk to anyone about us anyway.
[Ana signs the agreement]
Anastasia Steele: Are you gonna make love to me now?
Christian Grey: Two things: First, I don’t make love. I fuck, hard.
Anastasia Steele: And the second thing?
Christian Grey: Come.
[he holds out his hand for Ana to take]
Christian escorts Ana towards a room]
Christian Grey: It’s just around this door.
Anastasia Steele: What is?
Christian Grey: My playroom.
Anastasia Steele: Like your Xbox and stuff?
Christian Grey: It’s important that you know that you can leave at any time.
Anastasia Steele: Why? What’s in there?
Christian Grey: I meant what I said. The helicopter is on standby to take you whenever you want to go.
Anastasia Steele: Christian, just open the door.
[he unlocks the door, as they step inside Ana is visibly shocked at what she sees]
Anastasia Steele: Oh, my God.
[the room is filled with BDSM stuff like ropes, chains, whips and floggers]
[Ana touches one of the floggers]
Christian Grey: It’s called a flogger.
[Ana walks silently to touch another item]
Christian Grey: Say something, please.
Anastasia Steele: Do women do this to you or do you…?
Christian Grey: I do this to women. With women. Women who want me to.
Anastasia Steele: You’re a sadist?
Christian Grey: I’m a dominant.
Anastasia Steele: What does that mean?
Christian Grey: It means I want you to willingly surrender yourself to me.
Anastasia Steele: Why would I do that?
Christian Grey: To please me.
Anastasia Steele: To please you? How?
Christian Grey: I have rules, if you follow them, I’ll reward you. If you don’t, I’ll punish you.
Anastasia Steele: You’d punish me, like you’d use this stuff on me?
Christian Grey: Yes.
Anastasia Steele: What would I get out of this?
Christian Grey: Me.
[Christian escorts Ana to another room]
Christian Grey: If we were to do this, this would be your room. You can decorate it however you like.
Anastasia Steele: You want me to move in?
Christian Grey: Not full-time, just Friday through to Sunday. We can negotiate the particulars.
Anastasia Steele: So, I…so, I’d sleep in here with you?
Christian Grey: No, I’d be downstairs. I told you I don’t sleep with anyone.
[Christian escorts Ana downstairs]
Anastasia Steele: What if I don’t want anything to do with that?
Christian Grey: I would understand completely.
Anastasia Steele: But then we wouldn’t have any sort of relationship at all?
Christian Grey: This is the only sort of relationship I have.
Anastasia Steele: Why?
Christian Grey: It’s the way I am.
Anastasia Steele: When you said negotiate, what did you mean?
Christian Grey: I already have a contract prepared. It’s fairly detailed. You would review it and we would negotiate what you are and are not willing to try.
Anastasia Steele: How could I know what I’d be willing to try?
Christian Grey: Well when you’ve had sex, was there anything you didn’t like doing? We have to be honest with each other for this to work, okay?
[Ana down in embarrassment]
Anastasia Steele: I…I…I wouldn’t know.
Christian Grey: What do you mean?
Anastasia Steele: Because I haven’t…I haven’t…
Christian Grey: You’re still a virgin? I’ve just shown you…
Anastasia Steele: I know, I just…
Christian Grey: You’ve done other things, right?
Anastasia Steele: No.
[Christian touches her face tenderly]
Christian Grey: Where have you been?
Anastasia Steele: Waiting.
Christian Grey: Men must throw themselves at you.
Anastasia Steele: Never what I’ve wanted.
[Ana looks down, biting on her lip]
Christian Grey: You’re biting your lip.
[he kisses her]
Anastasia Steele: What are you doing?
Christian Grey: Rectifying the situation.
Anastasia Steele: I’m a situation?
[he takes Ana to his bedroom, slowly undresses, kisses her and proceeds to have sex with her; later Ana wakes when she hears Christian playing the piano downstairs, Ana goes over to him, they start kissing, he picks her up and takes her back to the bedroom]
[the next morning Christian walks in on Ana dancing as she fixes breakfast, startling her]
Christian Grey: You’re energetic this morning.
Anastasia Steele: You hungry?
Christian Grey: Very.
[Ana smiles]
Anastasia Steele: Cause I’m making pancakes.
[after eating breakfast Christian kisses Ana’s hand]
Christian Grey: Let’s get you cleaned up.
[in the bathroom Ana shyly undresses and they have a bath together]
[after bathing together Christian kisses Ana]
Christian Grey: Do you trust me?
[Christian removes the towel from Ana’s body and let’s down her hair]
Christian Grey: Stay here.
[he goes to his closet and gets one of his ties]
Christian Grey: Hold out your wrists.
[Ana holds out her wrists, Christian ties them together with his tie then drops her onto his bed, with her arms above her head as he lies on top of her]
Christian Grey: Hold them there, understand?
[Ana smiles at him]
Christian Grey: Tell me you understand.
Anastasia Steele: I won’t move my arms.
Christian Grey: Good girl.
[as Christian moves gently down her body, Ana moves her arms but Christian quickly pushes them over head again]
Christian Grey: Stay still.
Anastasia Steele: Okay.
[Christian moves down her body again]
Christian Grey: Say yes.
Anastasia Steele: To what?
Christian Grey: To being mine.
[just as he’s about to go down on her Christian’s adoptive mother, Grace, calls out]
Mrs. Grey: Christian!
Christian Grey: Shit. It’s my mother.
[Ana starts to laugh as Christian starts to untie her wrists]
Anastasia Steele: I’m naked.
Christian Grey: Get dressed.
[downstairs in Christian’s apartment Taylor is with Mrs. Grey]
Mrs. Grey: Taylor, there’s no need to show me around. And there’s no need to hover.
Taylor: He’s still sleeping, Dr. Grey.
Mrs. Grey: He’s still sleeping? But he never sleeps in. Certainly not at this hour. Unless of course he’s ill is he?
[just then Christian walks in]
Mrs. Grey: Ah.
Taylor: Sorry, Mr. Grey.
Christian Grey: It’s fine, I know how she can be.
[he kisses Mrs. Grey’s cheeks]
Mrs. Grey: She? Oh, well if you’re trying to avoid me, the very least you can do is call me by my correct name, which would be “mama.”
[Ana joins Mrs. Grey and Christian]
Anastasia Steele: Hi.
Mrs. Grey: Oh, dear God.
Christian Grey: Mother, Anastasia Steele. Ana, meet my mother. Dr. Grace Trevelyan Grey.
[Ana and Mrs. Grey shake hands]
Mrs. Grey: You have no idea how delighted I am to meet you.
Anastasia Steele: It’s nice to meet you too, Dr. Grey.
Mrs. Grey: Grace. She’s very pretty. You are very pretty.
Anastasia Steele: Thank you.
Christian Grey: What happened to calling before dropping by?
Mrs. Grey: Oh, and have your henchman give me the run around? No, thank you. I’ll take my chances. Well, I was in the neighborhood and I thought perhaps we could have lunch.
Christian Grey: I can’t today, I have to drive Ana home.
[just then Ana’s phone rings]
Christian Grey: It’s okay, take it. I was just showing mother out.
Anastasia Steele: Excuse me.
[Ana rushes to answer her phone]
Mrs. Grey: Anastasia!
[Ana answers her phone]
Anastasia Steele: Kate, hold on.
[Ana faces Mrs. Grey]
Mrs. Grey: It was a joy to meet you. And I’m having the whole family for dinner next week at my house. Christian’s sister Mia is back from Paris, you must come.
Christian Grey: We’ll see mother.
[Christian escorts his mother to the elevator]
Anastasia Steele: Nice to meet you.
Mrs. Grey: You too.
[Christian kisses Mrs. Grey goodbye as she steps into the elevator with Taylor]
Mrs. Grey: Thank you.
[upstairs Ana talks on the phone with Kate]
Anastasia Steele: I can’t talk about it right now, Kate.
[she walks into the bedroom he showed her last night]
Anastasia Steele: I…I gotta go. I’ll call you back, okay?
[Ana ends the call, walks into the room and sits on the bed]
Christian Grey: Everything okay with the phone call?
Anastasia Steele: Yeah, nothing important. I liked your mom.
Christian Grey: She’s excited. She’s never seen me with a woman before. You’re the first. What is it Ana?
Anastasia Steele: Um, I just…how many women have stayed in here?
Christian Grey: Fifteen.
Anastasia Steele: That’s a lot of women.
Christian Grey: I told you before, if you want out…
Anastasia Steele: I don’t want out. I’m just…I’m not exactly jumping at the opportunity to get whipped and tortured in your red room of pain.
Christian Grey: The room is much more about pleasure. I promise you.
Anastasia Steele: Would we still go out to dinner, and movies and…?
Christian Grey: That’s not really my thing. Try to keep an open mind. If you agree to be my submissive, I will be devoted to you. This is what I want. I want it with you.
Anastasia Steele: Why do I have to sleep in here? We slept in the same bed last night, like normal people.
Christian Grey: Try not to get hung up on the sleeping arrangements. If you agree to do this, you’re gonna want your own room.
Anastasia Steele: Why, cause I’ll be your sex slave?
Christian Grey: I don’t want to do this here, let’s talk downstairs.
Anastasia Steele: No. You know what, I think I’ll hold on to my freewill a little while longer, thank you. Actually, you know what? I would like to go home, can I go home?
[referring to the cars as they walk through the basement car park]
Anastasia Steele: Which one’s yours?
Christian Grey: All of them.
[Christian drives them to the woods and wakes up Ana from her nap]
Christian Grey: Let’s go for a walk.
[as they walk in the woods]
Anastasia Steele: How did you start doing this?
Christian Grey: One of my mother’s friends. I was fifteen.
Anastasia Steele: She seduced you?
Christian Grey: I was her submissive for six years.
Anastasia Steele: Seriously? Does your mother know that?
Christian Grey: Of course not. No one in my family knows about this part of me.
Anastasia Steele: So she introduced you to all this? Mrs. Robinson?
Christian Grey: Mrs. Robinson. I’ll tell her you said that, she’ll love it.
Anastasia Steele: You still talk to her?
Christian Grey: On occasions. We’re friends. Ana. I know how intimidating this is. I felt the same at first.
Anastasia Steele: Well, what made you change your mind?
Christian Grey: By giving up control, I felt free, from responsibility, from making decisions. I felt safe. You will too, you’ll see. I never took anyone in the helicopter. Never had sex in my own bed. Never slept with anyone. Ever. Only you.
[he kisses then drives her home, as he pulls outsider her apartment he gives her envelope]
Christian Grey: This is the contract. Read it carefully. Email me if you have any questions.
Anastasia Steele: I told you, my computer’s down.
Christian Grey: Just consider it, okay?
[he kisses her hand]
Christian Grey: I really hope you say yes.
[Ana gets out of the car]
Anastasia Steele: Thanks for the ride.
Christian Grey: Laters, baby.
[as Ana enters her apartment she sees a man setting up a laptop]
Anastasia Steele: Um…
Computer Technician: Okay, you’re all set. Your roommate let me in.
Kate: I just figured that you forgot to tell me about it. Do I look okay?
Anastasia Steele: Tell you about what?
Computer Technician: Just sign here.
Anastasia Steele: Hold on, do you have the right apartment?
Computer Technician: Anastasia Steele?
[Ana signs the form and notices it’s from Christian]
Computer Technician: Enjoy.
[the technician leaves]
Kate: Another gift, huh? Whatever happened to flowers and chocolate? I’m dying to hear everything, but I have to run right now because Elliot and I are having dinner and then we’re going to see show at the Gorge. Jose called for you, twice, by the way.
[she notices the envelope in Ana’s hand]
Kate: Did the mail already come?
Anastasia Steele: Oh, um, no. This is…these are my thesis notes, I left them at school.
Kate: Oh, alright. Well there’s yesterday’s mail.
[as Ana goes to check the mail Kate looks at her]
Anastasia Steele: What?
Kate: I don’t know. You look…different.
Anastasia Steele: I feel different.
Kate: Of course you do.
[they both smile]
Kate: Okay.
Anastasia Steele: Okay.
[Kate turns and walks out the front door]
Kate: Bye.
[as Ana site to look at her new laptop she receives a message from Christian]
“Thank you for a most interesting weekend. This laptop is yours. And I’d like you to use it for research.”
[Ana replies]
“Would you now? Is this what our relationship will be like, you ordering me around?”
[Christian replies]
Oh, I hope so. And what’s more, you’d like it.
[Ana looks over the contract Christian gave her with list of explanations for the dominant and submissive]
Christian Grey: [voice over] The following are the terms of a binding contract between the dominant and the submissive. The fundamental purpose of this contract. Is to allow the submissive to explore her sensuality and her limits safely. The dominant and the submissive agree and acknowledge that all that occurs under the terms of this contract will be consensual, confidential and subject to the agreed limits and safety procedures set out in this contract. The submissive will agree to any sexual activity deemed fit and pleasurable by the dominant, accepting those activities, outlined in hard limits.
[we see Ana and Kate packing their stuff in the apartment]
[as Christian is running he receives a message from Ana]
“Busy packing for our move to Seattle. Missing that tie…”
[we continue to hear Christian’s voice outlining their contract]
Christian Grey: [voice over] The submissive agrees to procure oral contraception from a physician of the dominant’s choosing. The submissive will not enter into sexual relations with anyone other than the dominant.
[we see Ana and Kate move into their new apartment in Seattle]
Christian Grey: [voice over] The submissive will eat regularly, to maintain her health and well-being from a prescribed list of foods. The submissive will not drink to excess smoke or take recreational drugs.
[we see Christian at a business meeting checking his phone for any messages from Ana]
Christian Grey: [voice over] The submissive shall always conduct herself in a respectful manner to the dominant, and she’ll address him only as Sir, Mr. Grey, or such other title as a dominant may direct.
[Ana receives a message from Christian as she continues to read the contract in her bed]
“Growing old here. Have you read the contract? Done your research?”
[Ana replies]
“On it…Sir. What should I research?”
Christian Grey: [voice over] The submissive may not touch the dominant without his expressed permission to do so.
[Christian sends another message to Ana]
“Try ‘submissive.’ Please.”
Christian Grey: [voice over] The safe word yellow will be used to bring to the attention of the dominant that the submissive is close to her limit. When the safe word red is spoken the dominant’s actions will cease completely and immediately.
[we see Ana researching submissives on the internet and looking shocked by the photos she finds]
Christian Grey: [voice over] Does the submissive agree to being restrained with hands bound in front? Does the submissive consent to being blindfolded? Does the submissive consent to being gagged? How much pain is the submissive willing to experience?
[we see Christian looking impatient sending another message to Ana]
“Has your research been productive? I’m impatient in Seattle.”
[Ana replies]
“It has…”
[speaks out loud as she types]
Anastasia Steele: It was nice knowing you.
[after getting doing her laundry Ana enters her bedroom when suddenly Christian shows up startling her]
Anastasia Steele: Christian.
Christian Grey: It’s been nice knowing me has it?
[Ana chuckles nervously, Christian places two glasses and a bottle of wine on the bedside table then drags her into his arms]
Christian Grey: Let me remind you how nice it was.
[he pushes her down onto the bed then holds up his tie]
Christian Grey: Is this what you want?
[Ana nods and holds out her wrists, Christian ties her wrists together, pushes her arms over her head and ties it to the bedpost]
Christian Grey: Don’t make a sound.
[Christian takes off her leggings, pulls her shirt over her eyes to serve as a blindfold, he kisses her body, runs an ice cube across her bare chest and stomach with his mouth, then turns her around and starts to have sex with her]
[after having sex]
Anastasia Steele: That was really nice.
Christian Grey: What are you doing to me?
[Ana touches his face but her pulls her hand away, Ana goes to touch his chest]
Anastasia Steele: What about here?
[Christian holds her hand to stop her]
Anastasia Steele: Why not? Is that breaking the rules?
Christian Grey: Speaking of which…
Anastasia Steele: I haven’t made up my mind yet.
[Christian gets up and starts to get dressed]
Anastasia Steele: You’re not staying?
Christian Grey: I told you, I don’t sleep with anyone.
Anastasia Steele: Can we negotiate?
[Christian smiles, kisses her on the head and turns to leave]
[the next morning Ana sends Christian a message]
“I have some issues with the paperwork.”
[Christian replies] “I’d be disappointed if you didn’t. Shall we discuss over dinner? Tonight?”
[Ana replies] “As this is a contract, I’d like a business meeting.”
[Christian replies] “Fine. I’ll wear a suit.”
[Ana replies] “I’ll be wearing a burlap sack.”
[later that night Ana goes to Grey House and is met by Christian as the elevator doors open]
Christian Grey: Now that’s a hell of a sack, Miss Steele.
[Christian escorts Ana to his office, as he goes to place his hand on her back she pushes it away]
Anastasia Steele: Business meeting.
[after they are seated at the meeting table]
Anastasia Steele: Impressive.
Christian Grey: I’ve done this before. Business meetings I mean.
Anastasia Steele: Oh. Uh…
Christian Grey: Miss Steele.
Anastasia Steele: Mm?
Christian Grey: Your meeting.
[Ana looks down at her contract]
Anastasia Steele: Page one, strike out my old address and replace with the new one.
Christian Grey: An oversight. Duly noted.
Anastasia Steele: Page three, section fifteen-twenty. “The submissive shall submit to any sexual activity demanded by the dominant and shall do so without hesitation or argument.”
[Ana chuckles but Christian gives her a serious look]
Anastasia Steele: Uh…turn to page five, appendix three, “soft limits.”
[Christian finds the section]
Christian Grey: With you.
Anastasia Steele: Find “anal fisting.”
Christian Grey: I’m all ears.
Anastasia Steele: Strike it out.
[Christian, looking disappointed, strikes it out]
Anastasia Steele: Strike out “vaginal fisting” too.
Christian Grey: Are you sure?
Anastasia Steele: Yep.
[Christian strikes it out]
Anastasia Steele: Same page. “Is the use of sex toys acceptable to the submissive.” Vibrators, okay. Dildos, fine. Genital clamps? Absolutely not.
Christian Grey: Consider them gone.
Anastasia Steele: What are butt plugs?
[just then two of Christian’s assistant enter with some food and wine which the leave on the table and leave]
Anastasia Steele: You must go through quite a few non-disclosure agreements.
Christian Grey: My staff know only what I choose to tell them. Please resume, Miss Steele.
Anastasia Steele: Also, on page five, there are some terms which need clarification. “Suspension.”
Christian Grey: Hanging on ropes from the ceiling.
Anastasia Steele: For what possible reason?
Christian Grey: For your pleasure.
Anastasia Steele: Really?
Christian Grey: And mine. Something to consider.
Anastasia Steele: No. Hard limit. “Is bondage acceptable to the submissive?” I’m good with rope. Leather cuffs, hand cuffs. Please lose tape. And, uh, what’s “other”?
Christian Grey: Cable ties.
[Ana smiles]
Christian Grey: Can I just say how impressed I am with your commitment to this meeting? And in that spirit, I’m gonna throw in a new sweeter. How about, once a week, on a night of your choosing, we go on a date. Just like a regular couple, dinner, movie, ice skating. Whatever you want.
Anastasia Steele: Accepted. You’re very kind.
Christian Grey: I’ll suggest it in Appendix five.
[they smile at each other]
[after they finish discussing the contract]
Christian Grey: I would like to fuck you into the middle of next week.
Anastasia Steele: You’re not fighting fair.
Christian Grey: I never have.
Anastasia Steele: I’ll review all these changes and try to arrive at a decision.
Christian Grey: You want to leave?
Anastasia Steele: Yes.
Christian Grey: But your body tells me something different. Your legs for instance. The way you’re pressing your thighs together under the table. And the change in your breathing. And in your complexion.
Anastasia Steele: My complexion?
Christian Grey: You’re flushed.
Anastasia Steele: That could just be the wine.
Christian Grey: It’s the adrenaline.
Anastasia Steele: Let’s say I did stay. What would happen?
Christian Grey: First, I would help you out of that little dress of yours.
Anastasia Steele: Yes.
Christian Grey: Then I’d be pleased to discover that you’re naked underneath.
Anastasia Steele: Really?
Christian Grey: Then I would bend you over.
Anastasia Steele: Right here?
Christian Grey: Yes.
Anastasia Steele: On this table?
Christian Grey: Yes.
[Ana bites her lower lip then looks at Christian]
Anastasia Steele: Thank you for the meeting, Mr. Grey.
[Ana rises and starts walks away]
[Christian escorts Ana to her car parked outside Grey House building]
Anastasia Steele: This is me. Didn’t know I was a collector of classic cars, huh?
Christian Grey: You’re sure I can’t persuade you to stay?
Anastasia Steele: Goodnight, Christian.
Christian Grey: When will you know?
Anastasia Steele: Soon, maybe.
[she kisses his cheek]
Christian Grey: Why do I think you’re telling me goodbye?
Anastasia Steele: Because I’m leaving.
[Ana gets into her car]
[Ana and Kate are at their graduation]
Anastasia Steele: You got your valedictory speech ready yet?
Kate: Oh, more or less.
Ray: Annie!
Anastasia Steele: Dad!
Ray: Ana’s father, Ray shows up and hugs Ana
Anastasia Steele: Hi.
Ray: Sorry I’m late, I had a hell of a time parking.
Anastasia Steele: That’s okay. You’re here, that’s all that matters.
Ray: You kidding me? I wouldn’t miss this for the world.
Anastasia Steele: I saved you a seat next to Kate’s parents, okay?
Ray: I’ll sit where you want, Miss Steele.
Anastasia Steele: Okay. I’ll see you after.
Ray: Yeah, good luck out there.
[at the graduation ceremony]
WSU University President: And he’s also a major benefactor to our university. Please join me in welcoming, Mr. Christian Grey.
[the crowd claps for Christian as he gets up to give speech]
Christian Grey: Thank you. I am deeply moved by the great compliment accorded to me today.
[as Christian is giving his speech Ana overhears two female grad students talking about him]
Female Grad #1: He is so hot.
Female Grad #2: Oh, my gosh. He so is.
Anastasia Steele: I heard he’s gay.
[as he continues to give his speech at the graduation ceremony]
Christian Grey: Sustainable methods of farming for third world countries. The goal? To eradicate hunger and poverty across the globe. I myself have known what it’s like to be profoundly hungry. So this is a very personal mission for me.
[the crowd claps; later as Ana gets her graduate certificate on the podium she walks over to Christian and shakes his hand]
Christian Grey: Congratulations, you must be very proud.
Anastasia Steele: I am. Nice tie, by the way.
Christian Grey: Truthfully it’s become my favorite. Do you have your answer yet?
Anastasia Steele: I’m still thinking.
Christian Grey: Anastasia, just try it my way. Please.
Anastasia Steele: Okay.
Christian Grey: What?
[Ana smiles and walks away]
[Ray hugs Ana at the graduation party]
Anastasia Steele: Dad, hi!
Ray: I’m so proud of you, Annie.
Anastasia Steele: Thank you!
Ray: And, Kate, best valedictorian speech ever.
Kate: Oh, thank you.
Ray: It was awesome.
Anastasia Steele: Yeah, I agree.
[just then Christian joins them]
Christian Grey: Ana? Hi.
Anastasia Steele: Hi.
Kate: Ray, have you met Christian Grey? Ana’s boyfriend?
Christian Grey: Ah. Great pleasure to meet you.
[Christian shakes Ray’s hand]
Ray: Likewise. I really enjoyed your speech.
Christian Grey: Thank you, sir.
Ray: Sounds like you’ve accomplished some pretty impressive things.
Kate: I’ll say. Well, I’m gonna go find my family, impatiently waiting to embarrass me. Bye.
[she kisses Ray’s cheek]
Kate: Come see us in Seattle soon?
Ray: Soon as I get an invitation. So, how long you two known each other?
Anastasia Steele: Um…
Christian Grey: A few weeks now.
Anastasia Steele: Mm-hmm.
Christian Grey: We actually met when Anastasia interviewed me for the student newspaper.
Graduation Photographer: A picture please, Mr. Grey?
[to Ray]
Christian Grey: Excuse us for one second.
[Christian takes Ana to one side to be photographed with him]
Graduation Photographer: Big smile now.
[Ana smiles uncomfortably as Christian pulls her next to him to be photographed]
[later at Ana’s apartment, Christian pours them some champagne into tea cups]
Christian Grey: To celebrate your graduation. Among other things.
[Ana rolls her eyes at him]
Christian Grey: Roll your eyes at me again and I will take you across my knee.
Anastasia Steele: Oh.
Christian Grey: So it begins.
[they are interrupted by the doorbell ringing]
Christian Grey: Come on, I have something to show you.
Anastasia Steele: What?
[Christian takes Ana outside her apartment building where Taylor is waiting next to a brand new red car]
Anastasia Steele: That’s cute. Doesn’t really seem like your style though.
Christian Grey: It’s not. Happy graduation, Anastasia.
[he hands a shocked looking Ana the car keys]
Anastasia Steele: Oh, my God. Christian, that’s a car.
Christian Grey: You don’t miss much, do you?
Anastasia Steele: Thank you, but I can’t. This is too…
Christian Grey: Do you like it?
Anastasia Steele: Of course I like it, it’s beautiful. But I have a car. I have… Where’s my car?
Christian Grey: I told Taylor to fetch a decent price.
Anastasia Steele: Christian, this is way too much.
Christian Grey: Did you just roll your eyes at me?
[Christian takes Ana back into her apartment, he sits on the couch and puts Ana over his knee to spank her]
Christian Grey: Do you know why I’m doing this?
Anastasia Steele: Because I rolled my eyes.
Christian Grey: And is that polite?
[Ana chuckles]
Anastasia Steele: No.
Christian Grey: Excuse me?
Anastasia Steele: No, sir.
[Christian pulls up her dress, pulls her pants down and spanks her twice]
Christian Grey: Do you want more?
[Ana doesn’t reply so he spanks her again]
Christian Grey: Welcome to my world.
[he pulls up her pants, fixes her dress]
[Christian kisses Ana then gets up to put on his jacket]
Anastasia Steele: What are you doing?
Christian Grey: I have a few things at the office that require my attention.
[Ana looks disappointed]
Christian Grey: You okay?
Anastasia Steele: I just thought that…
Christian Grey: I enjoyed tonight. I’ll see you at my place tomorrow.
[Christian leaves]
[after Christian leaves Ana gets a call from Carla]
Anastasia Steele: Hi, mama.
Carla: Anastasia, what’s going on? I’ve left you two messages this week.
Anastasia Steele: I know, I’m sorry. I…there, uh… I just got a little distracted.
Carla: Sorry I missed your graduation, honey. I heard it was lovely. And your new beau? Ray told me all about him, he sounds like quite a young man. Of course, I would’ve preferred to have heard about him from you.
Anastasia Steele: Ana starts crying
Carla: Ana? What’s the matter?
Anastasia Steele: Nothing, I’m fine.
Carla: Is he not making you happy?
Anastasia Steele: He is, yeah. Most of the time, yeah. It’s complicated.
Carla: Listen, honey, if…if you need a break, you just come right on down here. Even if it’s for a day or two. I have air miles, so we could talk and have girl time. Promise me you’ll think about it?
Anastasia Steele: Yeah, I promise. I promise. I love you, mama.
Carla: I love you too, darling.
Anastasia Steele: I gotta go. Bye.
Kate: Looks like you and Grey did some celebration last night.
[Ana laughs]
Kate: Is he still asleep?
Anastasia Steele: Uh…no, he couldn’t stay.
Kate: Whose car keys are those then?
Anastasia Steele: Those are my keys.
Kate: Wow, Ana.
Anastasia Steele: What?
Kate: Nothing, he just… Make sure you’re taking it at your own pace, okay?
Anastasia Steele: I am, I am. I gotta go.
Kate: Where are you going?
[Ana smiles and leaves the apartment]
[Ana’s is in Christian’s apartment when she picks up the newspaper which has the photo taken of her with Christian]
Anastasia Steele: Look at this.
Christian Grey: I’ve seen it. It’s not a bad picture.
Anastasia Steele: “Christian Grey with friend.” Says we’re friends.
Christian Grey: Well it must be true, if it’s in the paper.
Anastasia Steele: Mm.
Christian Grey: So how did it go with Dr. Greene?
Anastasia Steele: It was fine. But she said that I have to abstain from all sexual activity for four weeks. You know, after I start the pill.
Christian Grey: What?
Anastasia Steele: I’m just kidding.
[Ana smiles]
[Christian starts kissing her and lays her down on the couch]
Christian Grey: I want to take you to my playroom.
Anastasia Steele: But I haven’t signed the contract.
Christian Grey: I’m well aware. Call it due diligence.
Anastasia Steele: Okay.
[Christian and Ana stand outside his playroom holding hands]
Christian Grey: You ready?
[Ana nods her head, Christian unlocks his playroom and they enter]
[inside the playroom Christian kisses Ana]
Christian Grey: Eyes down. Take off your shoes.
[Ana kicks off her shoes]
Christian Grey: Arms above your head.
[Ana puts her arms above her head and Christian slowly removes her dress]
Christian Grey: You have a beautiful body, Anastasia. I want you unashamed of your nakedness, do understand?
Anastasia Steele: Yes, sir.
Christian Grey: You’re biting your lip. You know what that does to me, turn around.
[Ana turns and Christian starts platting her hair]
Christian Grey: When I tell you to come into this room this is how you’ll be. You’ll wait for me, kneeling by the door.
[Ana kneels down by the door]
Christian Grey: Hands flat on your thighs.
[Ana does as he says]
Christian Grey: Good.
[Christian goes and gets some S&M equipment then stands behind Ana]
Christian Grey: Hold out your hands.
[Ana holds out her hand, Christian uses the tip of a riding crop to stroke her neck and arm then hits the palm of her hand with the riding crop surprising Ana]
Christian Grey: Did that hurt?
Anastasia Steele: No.
Christian Grey: You see? Most of your fear is in your head. Come.
[Christian straps Ana’s arms above her head, then proceeds to act out his sexual desires on her after which he starts to whip her using the riding crop]
Christian Grey: How does that feel?
Anastasia Steele: Good.
[after he playfully hits Ana a couple of times]
Christian Grey: Quiet.
[after having sex Christian then carries Ana in his arms to her bedroom]
[Christian kisses Ana which wakes her, she opens her eyes to find no Christian but a dress on the chair; Ana walks down the stairs wearing the dress Christian had laid out for her]
Anastasia Steele: Where are we going?
Christian Grey: Remember my mother mentioned dinner? My sister Mia’s in town.
Anastasia Steele: Yep.
Christian Grey: You got everything you need?
Anastasia Steele: Yeah.
Christian Grey: Dance with me.
[Christian and Ana have a little dance before leaving]
[Christian and Ana enter the Grey residence]
Pigtailed Blonde Server: Good evening, Mr. Grey.
Mrs. Grey: They’re here! You’re here. Welcome, welcome.
Christian Grey: Ana, mother, you’ve met.
[Ana and Mrs. Grey embrace each other]
Anastasia Steele: Hi, lovely to see you.
Christian Grey: This is my father, Carrick.
Anastasia Steele: Hi, pleasure to meet you.
[they shake hands]
Mr. Grey: Nice to meet you too.
[Christian’s sister, Mia, walks down the stairs]
Mia Grey: Is she here?
[Mia goes over to Ana]
Mia Grey: Oh, my God! She exists!
[Mia embraces Ana]
[at the dinner table where Kate is also there as Elliot’s date]
Kate: It’s a great apartment, and the rent’s not ridiculous. Elliot and Jose helped us move in. Jose is Ana’s friend, although I think Elliot’s trying to poach him. They’ve sprout quite a bromance.
[Christian holds Ana’s hand under the table]
Elliot Grey: He’s a cool guy!
Mr. Grey: Ana, where is your family from?
Anastasia Steele: My step father’s in Montesano and my mom lives in Georgia.
Mrs. Grey: Georgia? Which part?
Anastasia Steele: Savannah.
Mrs. Grey: How nice! Although I do hear it gets rather humid in Georgia this time of year.
Anastasia Steele: Oh, my God, it does. It’s stifling sometimes.
[under the table we see Ana pushing Christian’s hand away from her lap]
Anastasia Steele: Actually, I’m going to visit her tomorrow.
Mrs. Grey: Oh, how nice.
[Christian looks surprised and displeased]
Anastasia Steele: Mm-hmm.
Mrs. Grey: You hear that, Christian? Some children do visit their parents now and again.
[quietly to Ana as Christian’s family are carrying on a conversation]
Christian Grey: This is news to me. When were you gonna tell me?
Mrs. Grey: Who wants coffee?
Christian Grey: Actually, I promised Ana a tour of the grounds. Excuse us.
[Christian escorts Ana around the grounds]
Anastasia Steele: Christian, I cannot walk that fast in these shoes.
[suddenly Christian picks Ana up and puts her over his shoulder]
Anastasia Steele: Ow!
Christian Grey: When were you gonna tell me about Georgia?
Anastasia Steele: What? You have no right to be mad!
Christian Grey: Yeah, but I am mad. Palm-twitchingly mad.
[he spanks Ana]
Anastasia Steele: Ow!
Christian Grey: You’re mine, all mine. Do you understand?
[he kisses Ana but she pulls away]
Anastasia Steele: Christian, you’re so confusing.
Christian Grey: Ana.
Anastasia Steele: What do you want? What do you want?
Christian Grey: I want you.
Anastasia Steele: I’m trying, Christian.
Christian Grey: I know you are.
Anastasia Steele: Why can’t we sleep in the same bed? Why won’t you let me touch you? Why does it have to be like this?
Christian Grey: If you’d just sign the contract you wouldn’t have to think about any…
Anastasia Steele: Why do you care so much about the contract, Christian? Don’t you like me the way I am?

Christian Grey: Of course I do.
Anastasia Steele: Then why are you trying to change me?
Christian Grey: I’m not. It’s…
Anastasia Steele: I need more, I want more.
Christian Grey: Hearts and flowers? That’s not something I know. Ana, please. It’s you that is changing me.
Anastasia Steele: Let me touch you. Let me.
[she kisses him]
[referring to the scars on Christian’s chest]
Anastasia Steele: Are they burns?
Christian Grey: I had a rough start in life. That’s all you need to know.
Anastasia Steele: Okay.
[at night, Christian comes to Ana’s room as she lies asleep in her bed]
Christian Grey: The woman that gave birth to me was a crack addict and a prostitute. She died when I was four. I remember certain things. Terrible things. I don’t remember her, but sometimes I think I see her in my dreams.
[he touches Ana’s hand and she wakes]
Christian Grey: Do you really have to go to Georgia?
Anastasia Steele: Yeah, I really do.
after Ana arrives in Georgia to visit Carla she is sat having dinner with Carla and her partner, Bob]
Carla: This gazpacho is very salty, Bob.
Bob: Yeah.
Carla: You’ll get fat with all this sitting around. You tell him, Ana.
Anastasia Steele: I’m not gonna tell him that.
Bob: Yes, thank you, Ana. I’m just saying that, you know, the gazpacho is basically eating a bowl of salsa. Now you should hand me some chips for my bowl of salsa?
Carla: You can have a carrot.
[she gives Bob a carrot]
Bob: Now what are you getting at with this?
[Carla laughs]
Bob: You know, you are damn lucky that I just happen to love you, very much.
Carla: I know that.
Bob: Do you?
Carla: Mm, I do
[later as Ana lies in bed, clearly missing Christian, she send him a text message]
“Missing you. Wish you were here.”
[Christian replies] “Me too. Having dinner with a friend tonight.”
[Ana replies] “What friend? Mrs. Robinson?”
[Christian replies] Don’t worry about it.
[Ana looks clearly upset; Christian decides to call Ana but she doesn’t hear the phone as it’s on silent]
[Ana and Carla are at a country club drinking cosmos]
Carla: Oh, darling, I think we should pace ourselves, or at least order something to eat.
Anastasia Steele: You go ahead, I’m not very hungry.
Carla: Oh, I’ll just have the fruit salad.
[Ana laughs, just then her phone vibrates as she gets a text message from Christian]
Carla: He can wait.
Anastasia Steele: Mom.
[Ana looks at Christian’s message]
“Another cosmo?”
Anastasia Steele: Holy fuck.
Carla: What? What is it?
Anastasia Steele: It’s Christian, he’s here. Um…in Georgia.
[just then Christian shows up at Ana and Carla’s table]
Carla: Oh. Here, here!
Christian Grey: Mrs. Adams, delighted to meet you.
[he shakes Carla’s hand]
Savannah Hotel Waiter: Something to drink sir?
Christian Grey: Gin and tonic. Hendrick’s if you have it, otherwise Bombay Sapphire. Cucumber with the Hendrick’s, lime with the Bombay.
Carla: I like him already.
[Carla laughs]
Anastasia Steele: What are you doing here, Christian?
Christian Grey: I came to see you.
Carla: I’m gonna step outside for a minute.
[Carla gets up and leaves]
[Christian sits next to Ana]
Anastasia Steele: I broke rule seven, clause five.
[as Ana goes to take a sip of her cosmo Christian takes the glass out of her hand]
Christian Grey: We’ll let it go. Let’s not talk about the contract right now.
Anastasia Steele: How was your dinner?
Christian Grey: She’s a friend, that’s all. She knows me.
Anastasia Steele: Well, what did she advise you to do?
Christian Grey: Well I’m here.
Anastasia Steele: And now what?
Christian Grey: I’ve got a room at this hotel.
Anastasia Steele: Well I hope you’ll be comfortable in it.
Christian Grey: What are you doing for breakfast tomorrow?
[the next morning in Christian’s car as he drives them]
Anastasia Steele: Where are we going?
Christian Grey: It’s a surprise.
Anastasia Steele: I think I’ve reached my quotas of surprises.
Christian Grey: We’re almost there.
[Christian takes them to an area for glider flying]
Glider Tow Pilot: Mr. Grey. Hey, I’ll be your tow pilot.
[he shakes hands with Christian]
Christian Grey: How do you do? This is my girlfriend, Anastasia Steele.
[Ana smiles as she and Christian are flying in the glider plane]
Glider Tow Pilot: We’re at two thousand feet, shall we release?
Christian Grey: Well?
[Ana laughs]
Anastasia Steele: Yeah, do it.
[to the tow pilot]
Christian Grey: Release.
[the tow pilot releases their glider plane allowing Christian to glide them around]
Christian Grey: Hold on tight.
[Christian turns the plane around]
Christian Grey: Is this more?
Anastasia Steele: Oh, my God. So much more!
[after their glider plane ride]
Anastasia Steele: Oh, my God. That was incredible, Christian. Thank you.
Christian Grey: Well we aim to please, Miss Steele.
Anastasia Steele: You said you didn’t do romance.
Christian Grey: I don’t.
Anastasia Steele: Yeah…
Christian Grey: Ana.
Anastasia Steele: What? What? Why are you fighting this? What are you afraid of?
[they are interrupted by Christian’s phone ringing]
Christian Grey: Grey. What? When? Tell Stephan to have the plane, I’ll be on the tarmac in thirty minutes.
Anastasia Steele: What happened?
Christian Grey: I have to go back to Seattle. Come, I’ll take you home.
[Carla drives Ana to the airport]
Carla: Oh, sweetheart, I wish Christian could’ve stayed. Bob was really looking forward to meeting him.
Anastasia Steele: I know, he had to get back to Seattle though. There’s some situation at work.
Carla: I wish I could tell you that things get easier, but they don’t. You just need to get to know yourself better.
Anastasia Steele: Thank you for everything, mama.
[they hug each other]
Carla: Take care of yourself, sweetheart.
Anastasia Steele: I will.
[back in Seattle Ana is met by Taylor at the airport holding up a card with her name on it]
Anastasia Steele: Did you think I wouldn’t recognize you, Taylor?
[Taylor drives Ana to Christian’s apartment]
Anastasia Steele: How does seem today, Taylor?
Taylor: Preoccupied I’m afraid.
Anastasia Steele: Really?
Taylor: Yes, ma’am.
[Christian is on the phone as Ana steps off the elevator and enters the apartment]
Christian Grey: Well that’s not gonna work. What? Well tell them that they don’t have twenty-four hours. That is unacceptable. I need to know. Just keep me informed.
[Christian ends the call, goes over to Ana and kisses her]
Anastasia Steele: Is everything okay?
Christian Grey: Nothing that concerns you.
Anastasia Steele: I can leave. Do you want me to go?
Christian Grey: No. That’s the last thing I want.
[he looks at her for a moment]
Christian Grey: I want you to be in the playroom in fifteen minutes.
[in the playroom as Ana lies on the bed Christian ties her hands]
Christian Grey: What are your safe words?
Anastasia Steele: Red and yellow.
Christian Grey: Remember those.
[after blindfolding her, Christian uses his equipment to stroke her body then whip her before finally having sex with her; later Ana hears Christian playing on his piano and she goes downstairs to be with him]
Anastasia Steele: That sounds so sad. Everything you play is so sad. You said you were six when you learned, was it because you wanted to please your new family?
[Christian doesn’t reply]
Anastasia Steele: I just want to talk. Why won’t you let me in? We should be talking.
Christian Grey: Like normal people?
Anastasia Steele: Yeah. Is that so wrong?
[Ana goes to touch his face but Christian pushes her hand away, he then gets up to walk away]
Anastasia Steele: Is this because of the contract? Because I still haven’t signed it?
Christian Grey: Fuck the contract, I think it’s a little redundant don’t you?
Anastasia Steele: So then the rules are redundant too?
Christian Grey: No, the rules stand.
Anastasia Steele: And what if I break them?
Christian Grey: Then there’ll be consequences.
Anastasia Steele: Punishment?
Christian Grey: Yes.
Anastasia Steele: Why do you want to punish me?
Christian Grey: Ana.
Anastasia Steele: Why do you want to hurt me?
Christian Grey: I would never do anything to you that you couldn’t handle.
Anastasia Steele: But why do you even want to do anything to me at all, Christian?
Christian Grey: If I told you, you’d never look at me the same way again.
Anastasia Steele: So there is a reason. Tell me. Do you want to punish me right now?
Christian Grey: Yes, I want to punish you right now.
Anastasia Steele: What if I told you that I feel the same way about being punished as you do about me touching you, would you still want to punish me then?
Christian Grey: No. But that doesn’t mean I wouldn’t need to.
Anastasia Steele: Why?
Christian Grey: Ana, stop.
Anastasia Steele: Why do you need to…?
Christian Grey: Because it’s the way I am! Because I’m fifty shades of fucked up.
Anastasia Steele: Show me then.
[Ana turns to face him with tears running down her face]
Anastasia Steele: I need you to show me, what you want to do to me. Punish me, show me how bad it can be. I want you to show me the worst. It’s the only way I can understand.
[Christian takes Ana to the playroom]
Christian Grey: Are you sure about this?
Anastasia Steele: Yes.
[he strips her naked]
Christian Grey: Bend over.
[Ana bends over a table]
Christian Grey: I’m gonna hit you six times, and you’re gonna count with me.
[Christian starts to whip Ana’s buttocks with a belt making her wince in pain]
Christian Grey: Count, Anastasia.
Anastasia Steele: One.
[he whips her again]
Anastasia Steele: Two.
[he whips her again and Ana starts to cry]
Anastasia Steele: Three.
[another whip]
Anastasia Steele: Four.
[another whip]
Anastasia Steele: Five.
[his final whip]
Anastasia Steele: Six.
[tears roll down Ana’s face]
[as Christian goes to help Ana off the table she pushes him away and faces him as she cries]
Anastasia Steele: Is this what you really want? You want to…you want to see me like this?
Christian Grey: Ana.
Anastasia Steele: Don’t come near me. Does this give you pleasure?
[Christian goes to take step closer to her]
Anastasia Steele: Don’t. Don’t you dare come near me.
[Ana turns and leave the room; later Christian comes to Ana’s room as she lies on her bed crying]
Christian Grey: Please don’t hate me.
Anastasia Steele: You’ll never do that to me again. I’m not what you want.
Christian Grey: No, you’re…you are everything that I want.
Anastasia Steele: I’ve fallen in love with you.
Christian Grey: No. No, Ana, you can’t love me.
Anastasia Steele: I need you to leave. Please.
[Christian reluctantly leaves the room and Ana bursts into tears]
[last lines; the next morning as Christian is sat in a chair, Ana dressed to leave, comes downstairs and places the laptop he gave her on the table]
Anastasia Steele: I’d like my car back.
Christian Grey: Taylor already sold it.
Anastasia Steele: Then I’d like the money he got for it, please.
Christian Grey: I’ll send you a check.
Anastasia Steele: Okay.
Christian Grey: Taylor will take you home.
[Ana turns and heads for the elevator, Christian follows her]
Anastasia Steele: Stop.
[Christian doesn’t stop]
Anastasia Steele: No!
[Christian abruptly stops in his tracks, Ana turns and enters the elevator, as the doors are about to close]
Christian Grey: Ana.
Anastasia Steele: Christian.
[the elevator doors close]
